## Problem Statement :
In this project, Create a Power BI dashboard for the call center manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

Possible KPIs include (but are not limited to):

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered


## Datasource :

The dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu/pw-c-switzerland/power-bi-cqxg/call-centre-trends) and call center trends dataset:

Dataset: [Call Centre Trends](https://github.com/ValentynSobeiko/PwC-Power-BI-Projects/blob/main/PWC%20Call%20Center%20Project%20-%20Valentyn.pbix)

## Data Preparation:

Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset was loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

The call Centre Trends dataset is given in the table named:

- `Call Center trends dataset` which has `10 columns and 5000 rows` of observation

Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:

- Removed Unnecessary columns
- Removed Unnecessary rows
- Each of the columns in the table was validated to have the correct data type
